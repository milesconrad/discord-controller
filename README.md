# discord-controller
A discord bot that takes messages from a given channel and executes them as keyboard and mouse commands.

After you've installed the packages in `requirements.txt`, you will need to add a bot token, and make sure there is a `#pc-control` channel in the server you are using.

Of course, this is not something I would recommend you do with <i>anyone</i> you do not completely trust. This is a program meant to be used for messing with your friends and possibly providing tech support. It is by no means recommended you use this with anyone outside of your immediate family or friend group.

# instructions
To press keys, simply type the name of the key:
`w` would press the `W` key, and `ctrl` would press the `Control` key

Here is a reference for the names of some of the special keys:
`win`, `ctrl`, `alt`, `enter`, `return`, `shift`, `capslock`, `backspace`

And for arrow keys:
`left`, `right`, `up`, `down`

To control the mouse, use commands:
`mup` - moves the mouse up
`mdown` - moves the mouse down
`mleft` - moves the mouse left
`mright` - moves the mouse right
`m1` - presses left click
`m2` - presses right click

Finally, if you want to type something, use the `say` command, followed by what you want to type:
`say hello this is pc-control` will output `hello this is pc-control`
