# discord-controller
A discord bot that takes messages from a given channel and takes them as keyboard and mouse 
commands. In order to use it you'll need to install pydirectinput, pynput, and discord.py
using pip.

Of course, this is not something I would recommend you do with <i>anyone</i> you do not 
completely trust. This is a program meant to be used for messing with your friends and 
possibly providing tech support. It is by no means recommended you use this with anyone 
outside of your immediate family or friend group.
