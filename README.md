# discord-controller
A discord bot that takes messages from a given channel and executes them as keyboard and mouse commands.

After you've installed the packages in `requirements.txt`, you will need to add a bot token, and make sure there is a #pc-control channel in the server you are using.

Of course, this is not something I would recommend you do with <i>anyone</i> you do not completely trust. This is a program meant to be used for messing with your friends and possibly providing tech support. It is by no means recommended you use this with anyone outside of your immediate family or friend group.
